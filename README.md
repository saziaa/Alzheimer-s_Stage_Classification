## ðŸ“Œ Project Title

**ðŸ§  Lightweight Deep Learning for Alzheimerâ€™s Stage Classification: A Fine-Tuned VGG16 Approach**

## ðŸ“– Project Overview 
This project explores **deep learningâ€“based classification of Alzheimerâ€™s disease stages** using brain MRI scans. Leveraging **transfer learning with VGG16**, the model distinguishes four diagnostic stages:

- Non-Demented

- Very Mild Dementia

- Mild Dementia

- Moderate Dementia

The goal is to build a lightweight yet accurate model that can support early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease by identifying subtle neurodegenerative patterns in MRI images.
